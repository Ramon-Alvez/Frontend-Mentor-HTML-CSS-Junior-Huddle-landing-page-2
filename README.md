## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned 📚

I'm improving my hability to create Landing pages using Grid and flexbox.

### Continued development 🚀

My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.

### Useful resources 🎒

- [Criando landing page completa do ZERO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzc_dnqD-V0) - This helped me because I was spacing the page in an ineffective way (with margin, padding or max-width), but when I saw it centering using % it was like a eureka inside my head.
